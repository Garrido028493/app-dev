> ***Who is the most important character in Toy Story?***

***Woody.*** It all comes down to Woody, the main character of every single "Toy Story" movie. It couldn't be anyone else but Woody at the top, as every film sends Woody on a unique emotional journey and remarkable physical adventure. Through a ton of incredible moments, Woody experiences more development than any other character, which is why Woody is adored the world over.

When Buzz Lightyear first enters Andy's room, Woody is terrified and uses his fear as a weapon to try to take down Buzz so he can remain as Andy's undisputed favorite. Over time his cruelty fades as Woody realizes it's not the right thing to do, and throughout the four films, Woody is unquestionably the gang's moral compass. They look to him for guidance in almost every situation, which is what makes him their unshakable leader.

His incredible journey comes to an emotional yet satisfying conclusion in "Toy Story 4," when Woody makes the incredibly tough choice to leave his friends behind for a new start at life with Bo Peep and the lost toys. For the first three films, Woody has been terrified of being left alone, with nobody there to play with him. Both his beloved owners, Andy and Bonnie, have moved on from him, but Woody manages the most challenging feat of all –- finding value in yourself and not solely in how you relate to others. 

Woody's decision perfectly crystalizes his character development and cements his place as the greatest character in "Toy Story." After all, he's the rootinest, tootinest cowboy in the wild, wild west.
